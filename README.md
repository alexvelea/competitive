# problems

Here you can a big part of the problems that i've solved.
Most of them are correct, but i'm not sure thou.

If you want to learn some new tricks or maybe see another aproach for a problem, feel free to take a look.
I recommend the most reecent problems as reference material because the coding style it's much better.
